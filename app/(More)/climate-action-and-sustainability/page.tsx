These challenges provoke different and often strong reactions and there is a risk we become polarised and isolated. It is only through meaningful human connection and dialogue that we can begin to coalesce and find shared solutions, looking to a fair and sustainable way of living.",

We have the skills to generate awareness and high quality thinking. We are proud of our role in 2022 in revising the Global Code of Ethics, which is now much clearer about our responsibilities in benefitting society more broadly.",
